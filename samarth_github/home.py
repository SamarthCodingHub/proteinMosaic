    **Protein Molecule Mosaic** is an interactive web application for exploring and analyzing protein structures (PDB files).

    ### Objectives:
    - Make protein structure visualization accessible and interactive
    - Allow users to upload or fetch PDB files for analysis
    - Identify and classify ligands and predict active sites
    - Generate and analyze Ramachandran plots

    ### Features:
    - 3D visualization of protein structures (cartoon, surface, sphere)
    - Upload PDB files or fetch by PDB ID
    - Ligand classification (ion, monodentate, polydentate)
    - Active site prediction based on catalytic residues
    - Ramachandran plot generation with region analysis
    - User-friendly sidebar controls
